Direct Democracy is designed around the concept of lighting a fire under your representatives. It serves as a platform for asking important political questions, and taking stances on issues that you care about. A user can agree with an existing stance on an issue or create a new one. Each issue, user, and congressional district has data visualization that plots the most prevalent views, importance of the issues, and more.

+ Implemented a Rails API backend to store user, issue, vote, and district data

+ Created a single-page frontend built on React, React-router, and Redux, including full auth with JWT and localStorage

+ Enforced full data validations, including valid street address to map to congressional districts

+ Styled front end using Semantic UI React, ChartJS 2’s React wrapper, as well as custom CSS and logos created in Photoshop
